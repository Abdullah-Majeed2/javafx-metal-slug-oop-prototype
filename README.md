# Metal Slug OOP Prototype (JavaFX)

This is a **JavaFX-based prototype** of a Metal Slug-style 2D side-scrolling platformer, developed as part of my Object-Oriented Programming coursework. The project demonstrates key **OOP principles** such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction through a single playable level.

> ⚠️ Note: This is a **prototype** created for coursework. It is not a full game but demonstrates core mechanics, player movement, collision detection, basic enemies, projectiles, and simple AI using JavaFX. Sprites and sounds of original game are used for demonstration purposes only.

## Project Overview

- Built using **Java** and **JavaFX** in **IntelliJ IDEA**.
- Libraries used are  **JavaFX** and **Gson**.
- Implements a **custom game engine**, physics manager, animation system, and input handling.  
- Core features:  
  - Player movement and shooting  
  - Basic enemies with AI  
  - Collision detection with platforms and objects  
  - Dynamic sprite-based animations  
  - One playable level to demonstrate OOP concepts
